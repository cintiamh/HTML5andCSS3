# Web Page Building Blocks

## The Importance of Semantics

Semantics is important specially when using screen readers (voice over) features.

## Filenames

Files names are important for search engines. For search engines, it's better to name the files with dashes `-` between words.
Like: `my-favorite-bands.html`.

## Connecting pages

HTML pages are composed by tags.
Tags contains attribute values and element values.

## Elements, attributes and values

You can link pages using absolute and relative URLs.

`/` - root URL.

## Editing an HTML file

The browser automatically looks for `index.html` and `default.html` for home page.

Create an `assets` folder for `css` and `img` for organizing.

## Running web files on your local computer

On Mac, go to:

System Preferences => Sharing => Web Sharing

Edit the files inside your sites folder.
